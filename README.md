PySmartLights

This will be a light controller to run on Raspberry Pi with an 8-relay adapter and dimmer module, and a 3.5in touch screen, to control up to 8 light groups.

These groups can be dynamically grouped into four switch types: All, TV, Mood, Walkway (Minimal).

A longer click will switch to mode configuration panel.  Here, you may configure which light groups are active in any given mode.

A ~5 seconds click on 'All' will open the settings panel. This is to authorize or block specific cell phones from controlling this light group.
